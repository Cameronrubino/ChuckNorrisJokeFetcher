# AGENTS

Prompts used (user-style):

- "Create a compact CLI that fetches Chuck Norris jokes. Provide random, categories, search subcommands. Keep it testable and include CI." 
- "Write tests that mock network calls so CI remains deterministic."

Implementation notes: uses https://api.chucknorris.io
